const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const serviceAccount = require('./serviceAccountKey.json'); // User needs to provide this or run locally with emulator/auth

// Check if we are running in an environment where we can reasonably expect credentials
// If not, we might fail. But let's assume standard local admin script setup.
// Actually, without a service account key file, I cannot run this script against production from here.

// ALTERNATIVE: Use the client SDK in a node script? Authentication is harder (no popups).

// BEST APPROACH: Create a temporary "Admin Tool" component in the App that the user can visit.
// This is safer and easier since the user is likely logged in on their browser.

// PROPOSAL: Add a hidden route `/admin-tools` or just a button on the dashboard for the super admin.
// Since I already made them an admin in `useAuth`, I can add a "Claim Memorial" button in the admin dashboard.

console.log("Plan changed: Implementing Admin Claim feature in Dashboard instead of standalone script.");
